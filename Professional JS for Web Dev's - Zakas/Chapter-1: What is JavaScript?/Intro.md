What is JavaScript?
===

History
--
* **1995**: Project started by [Brendan Eich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich "Know more at Wikipedia") at Netscape with scripting language called *Mocha*, which was later renamed to *LiveScript*.
Then, Netscape entered into development alliance with Sun Microsystems and later name of *LiveScript* was changed to *JavaScript* to capitalize buzz of Java at that time.
* **1996**: With increasing popularity of *JavaScript 1.0*, Microsoft decided to invest in new competiting browser called *Internet Explorer (IE)* introducing its own JavaScript implementation called *JScript*. This major step by Microsoft started journey of development of *JavaScript* as a language.
* **1997**: Now, with Microsoft's implementation of *JScript* and Netscape's implementation of *JavaScript* there were 2 different versions of this scripting language which caused standardization issues so, *JavaScript 1.1* was submitted to the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) as a proposal and Technical Committee #39 (TC39) was assigned to standardize the syntax and semantics of a general purpose, cross-platform, vendor-neutral scripting language which resulted in **ECMA-262**, a standard defining a new scripting language
named *ECMAScript*. Since then all browsers use *ECMAScript* as a basis for their JavaScript implementations.

1. The Core (*ECMAScript*)
2. DOM (Document Object Model)
3. BOM (Browser Object Model)
